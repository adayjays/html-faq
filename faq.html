            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s1">Can I trade in my old device for a new one?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s1">
                <p>Yes, many manufacturers and retailers offer trade-in programs that allow you to exchange your old
                    device for credit towards a new one. Check with the manufacturer or retailer for specific details
                    and eligibility requirements.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s2">What devices are eligible for trade-in?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s2">
                <p>The devices eligible for trade-in vary depending on the program and the condition of your device. In
                    general, newer devices and those in good working condition are more likely to be eligible for
                    trade-in.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s3">How do I find out the trade-in value of my device?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s3">
                <p>You can usually find out the trade-in value of your device by visiting the manufacturer's or
                    retailer's website and using their trade-in calculator. You'll need to provide information about the
                    make, model, and condition of your device to get an estimate.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s4">Do I need to include accessories when trading in my device?
            </h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s4">
                <p>It depends on the trade-in program's requirements. Some programs may only require the device itself,
                    while others may ask for accessories such as chargers and cables. Be sure to check the specific
                    requirements before sending in your trade-in.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s5">What should I do before trading in my device?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s5">
                <p>Before trading in your device, make sure to back up your data and perform a factory reset to erase
                    your personal information. This will protect your privacy and ensure that your data is not
                    accessible to others.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s6">Can I trade in a device with a cracked screen or other damage?
            </h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s6">
                <p>The eligibility of a device with damage for trade-in depends on the program's criteria. Some programs
                    accept devices with minor damage, while others may require the device to be in good condition. Check
                    with the trade-in program for specific guidelines.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s7">Will I receive cash or credit for my trade-in?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s7">
                <p>The trade-in value is usually provided as credit towards the purchase of a new device. In some cases,
                    you may receive a gift card or store credit. Rarely, cash may be offered for certain trade-ins.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="accordion-toggle" data-target="s8">Can I trade in a device that is locked to a carrier?</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content" id="s8">
                <p>Carrier-locked devices are often eligible for trade-in, but they may have different trade-in values
                    compared to unlocked devices. Some trade-in programs may accept carrier-locked devices, while others
                    may not. Check the program's terms and conditions for details.</p>

                <h3>What are the differences between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker?</h3>
                <p>A smartwatch is a wearable device that combines the features of a watch and a smartphone. It can be
                    used
                    to make and receive calls, send and receive texts, and get notifications from your phone. It can
                    also
                    track your fitness, control your music playback, and make payments.</p>
                <p>A fitness tracker is a wearable device that is specifically designed to track your fitness. It can
                    track
                    your steps, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. It can also show you how active you've been
                    throughout the day.</p>
                <p>The main difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker is that a smartwatch has more
                    features. A
                    fitness tracker is more focused on tracking your fitness, while a smartwatch can do that and more.
